        <h1>The LCU Story</h1>
        <p align = "left">LION Credit Union was established in 2013 by a group of Columbia students who wished to create a student-run, not-for-profit financial cooperative dedicated to furthering the financial well-being of the Columbia community. After it became clear in 2014 that there was widespread support for our initiative among the Columbia community, LCU began looking for a partner institution to help us develop tailored, competitive financial products for the Columbia family. There were around 380 credit unions in the tri-state areas, so it took a while for us to find the best partner for our community! By 2016, we had established our partnership with USALLIANCE Financial, a $1+ billion financial institution that serves as the credit union for corporations such as American Express, PepsiCo, and IBM. Through our partnership, we're able to maintain operational transparency while improving the financial lives of Columbia students, staff, faculty, alumni, and their immediate families through our superior product offerings and financial literacy initiatives.<br/><br/>As of fall 2017, we're officially launching our suite of financial products that we hope will improve the financial health of our Columbia family.</p>

      <center><h2>What's a Credit Union?</h2>
        <p align = "left">Credit unions are not-for-profit financial institutions that offer similar products to commercial banks but operate very differently. Unlike traditional banks, credit unions are completely owned by their members and account-holders rather than shareholders, which means that they are often able to offer better products and better returns. Additionally, rather than serving the general public, credit unions only serve specific groups of members known as the field of membership. For LCU, the field of membership includes all Columbia students, staff, faculty, alumni, and their immediate families.<br/><br/>The National Credit Union Administration (a federal agency) regulates credit unions, and accounts with federally-insured credit unions like LCU are insured by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund up to $250,000 per individual.</p>
