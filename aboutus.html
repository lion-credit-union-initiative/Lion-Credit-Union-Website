A credit union is a community-oriented, not-for profit financial institution that offers all of the services that a traditional bank does, but which specifically serves the members of a specific community.

<i><u>Better Rates:</u></i> We provide better savings and interest rates than commercial banks do, while providing the same services at of the same level of quality and security -- meaning that up to $250,000 of your money is federally insured.
          
          </p>
      <p><i><u>Better Service:</u></i> We are here to address your wants and needs. Our team is composed of some of the brightest and most passionate people at Columbia who are here to serve you, and furthermore we are backed by a well-established partner credit union. 
</p>
